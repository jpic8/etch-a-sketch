This assignment really has me wracking my brain. I need to find the balance between what should be done with CSS and what should be done with JavaScript. This original rough draft does not account for user input at all and is actually and 80x80 grid of 10x10px divs. I need to refactor using CSS grid instead of just forcing items into a flexbox, but it is functional at least. I look forward to revisiting and upgrading this project.
